# Stacks
## Last-In First-Out! (LIFO)
- think of a stack as a vertical tower
- can only access the most recent *(very top)* variable
- must remove each top variable to access lower ones

## Functions:
### push
- adds a variable to the top of the stack
- could potentially run out of memory

### pop
- removes the most recent addition
    - top of the tower
### pop
- displays topmost variable</br>
### search
- returns the *(index + 1)* of the entered variable
    - e.x: `stack.search("Minecraft")` would return its correspoding index value added 1
- if not in stack, returns `-1`</br>
### check if empty
- returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty or not
